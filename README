This is the github repository for the Pablo project. 

Pablo is a very basic random sentence generator -- a natural language generation engine that randomly selects word parts of speech (mad lib style) from a database of words. 

The repository is setup the embed the Pablo algorithm within a django application that is currently online at 
  http://thesexycow.com

The imports will check for the existence of django databases and if unavailable use an alternate 'test' wordlist, allowing people to pull the repository and execute the Pablo algorithm without needing to install django in their environment.
